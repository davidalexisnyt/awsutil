awsdo init - Initialize AWS CLI, SSM plugin, and AWS SSO profile

DESCRIPTION:
    The init command helps you set up AWS CLI, SSM plugin, and configure your
    first AWS SSO profile. It performs prerequisite checks and guides you
    through the installation process if needed.

    The command will:
    - Check if AWS CLI is installed and accessible
    - Check if SSM plugin is installed and accessible
    - Check if AWS profiles are configured
    - Install missing components (when possible via package managers)
    - Guide you through setting up your first AWS SSO profile

USAGE:
    awsdo init

EXAMPLES:
    awsdo init
        Run the initialization wizard to set up AWS CLI, SSM plugin, and
        configure your first AWS SSO profile.

NOTES:
    - On Windows, the command will try to use Winget if available
    - On macOS, the command will try to use Homebrew if available
    - On Linux, the command will try to use apt, yum, dnf, or zypper if available
    - If package managers are not available, you will be guided through manual
      installation steps
    - You will need SSO information from your AWS administrator to set up a profile
