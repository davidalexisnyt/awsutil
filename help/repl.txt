awsdo repl - Start interactive REPL mode

USAGE:
    awsdo repl

DESCRIPTION:
    Starts an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) mode that provides a
    convenient shell-like interface for executing awsdo commands. In REPL
    mode, you can type commands directly without the 'awsdo' prefix, and
    the configuration is automatically saved after each successful command.

FEATURES:
    - Command shortcuts for faster typing
    - Automatic configuration saving after each command
    - Screen clearing with Ctrl-L
    - Multiple exit options
    - Built-in help system

COMMANDS:
    All standard awsdo commands are available in REPL mode:
    - login
    - instances (find, list/ls, add, update, remove/rm)
    - terminal
    - bastion
    - bastions (list/ls, add, update, remove/rm)
    - help, :help, .h
    - docs
    - clear/cls/clr/.c

COMMAND SHORTCUTS:
    ls      Shortcut for 'instances list' or 'bastions list'
    rm      Shortcut for 'instances remove' or 'bastions remove'
    up      Shortcut for 'bastions update'
    clear   Clear the screen (also: cls, clr, .c)
    help    Show help (also: :help, .h)
    quit    Exit REPL (also: q, :q, .q, exit, :exit, .exit)

EXIT COMMANDS:
    To exit the REPL, use any of the following:
    - quit, q, :q, .q
    - exit, :exit, .exit
    - Ctrl-D (EOF)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
    Ctrl-L      Clear the screen and return to prompt
    Ctrl-D      Exit the REPL

EXAMPLES:
    Start REPL:
        awsdo repl

    In REPL mode:
        awsdo>> login -p dev
        awsdo>> instances find myapp
        awsdo>> instances ls
        awsdo>> terminal myinstance
        awsdo>> bastions ls
        awsdo>> bastion
        awsdo>> help instances
        awsdo>> quit

NOTES:
    - The REPL automatically saves your configuration after each successful
      command, so you don't need to worry about losing changes.
    - Empty lines are ignored.
    - The prompt is displayed in green (awsdo>>) to indicate REPL mode.
    - All commands work exactly the same as in normal mode, just without
      the 'awsdo' prefix.
